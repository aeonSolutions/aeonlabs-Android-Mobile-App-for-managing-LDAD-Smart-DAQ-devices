**Current project Total: 320 work.h**

Since last June 2021, amid Covid-19, Iâ€™ve been designing a live data acquisition device (LDAD) for monitoring sensor data. It uses an Arduino board coupled with a custom PCB board and commercially available Arduino shields.


The LDAD uses RFID NFC technology for fast identification and connection to nearby authorized devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or any other that uses Bluetooth BLE or WiFi technologies. Custom software applications are being developed for handling and managing collected data from devices compatible with LDAD in accordance with the latest guidelines on Open Data available at the European Commission website and also following the latest guidelines available on open-source development and maintenance (see snapshot below of the Android App under development).
